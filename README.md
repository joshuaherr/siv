## Core Security Goals

- **Authenticated voters:** Only legitimately registered voters are allowed to vote, and only once per person.
- **Private voting:** A fair election requires that voters can freely choose without anyone learning how they voted.
- **Verifiable tallies:** For widely accepted results, vote totals must be independently auditable for accuracy.

## License & Restrictions

SIV is designed to [create verifiable proof of accurate election results](https://docs.siv.org/verifiability), without needing to inspect any source code â€” which is not feasible of remote servers anyway.

Nonetheless, the SIV Source Code is made available for transparency, to enable deep security inspections.

Permission is **_not granted_** for commercial or governmental usage, without first acquiring a separate Commercial or Government License. Contact team@siv.org if interested.

## Local Development Instructions

### Initial set up

1. Fork the repo
2. Duplicate the file `.env.local.TEMPLATE` into `.env.local`
3. Create (free) accounts with the providers listed in that file, adding your new API keys. [These detailed instructions](/cloud-services.md) can help if stuck.
4. Install local dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Then, to start dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

And you should see:

> Ready - server started on http://localhost:3000
